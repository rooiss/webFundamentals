	Starting off the assignment using the install command was the most straight forward.
    pip install, installs a package when the virtual environment is activated. 
    pip list seemed to just list all of the installed packages, but only worked when 
    the virtualenv was activated. Deactivate just deactivated the virtualenv. 
    pip3 list showed all installed packages even when the virtualenv was deactivated. 
    The difference between freeze and list was the formatting of the lists were 
    different, as in formatting for freeze was organized alphabetically where list was 
    not.
